# Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) & DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

SRP refers to the idea that a function or class or method should be responsible
for just as much functionality as is necessary...no more, no less.

## Single Responsibility Principle: Do one thing and do it well

Following the guidelines of SRP sets up easier to read code that just makes more
sense.

## DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself

Making code that is more readable and more reusable should be every programmer's
goal. By taking a critical look at your code and identifying places where you
may have identical logic repeated throughout and creating smaller, more reusable
functions or methods to contain that logic, allows you to write code that other
programmers will be able to follow more closely and accurately, leading to
maintainable code.

The opposite of DRY coding is, of course, WET. We Enjoy Typing.
