# Array practice

Identify the time complexity of each of these functions with a 1 sentence
justification for your answer. Assume `arr` is an array of length _n_.

## `arr.push()`

Time complexity: O(1)
Space complexity: O(?)
Justification: because only one operation.

[push on MDN][push]

## `arr.pop()`

Time complexity: O(1)
Space complexity: O(?)
Justification: because only one operation.

[pop on MDN][pop]

## `arr.shift()`

Time complexity: O(1)
Space complexity: O(?)
Justification: because only one operation.

[shift on MDN][shift]

## `arr.unshift()`

Time complexity: O(1)
Space complexity: O(?)
Justification: because only one operation.

[unshift on MDN][unshift]

## `arr.splice()`

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(?)
Justification: because 2 parameter can be n size

[splice on MDN][splice]

## `arr.slice()`

Time complexity: O(1)
Space complexity: O(?)
Justification: because only one operation.

[slice on MDN][slice]

## `arr.indexOf()`

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(?)
Justification: depends on length of arr for worst case

[indexOf on MDN][indexOf]

## `arr.map()`

Time complexity: O(n^3)
Space complexity: O(?)
Justification: best case O(n) worst can be worse than O(n^3)

[map on MDN][map]

## `arr.filter()`

Time complexity: O(n^3)
Space complexity: O(?)
Justification: best case O(n) worst can be worse than O(n^3)

[filter on MDN][filter]

## `arr.reduce()`

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(?)
Justification: depends on size of array

[reduce on MDN][reduce]

## `arr.reverse()`

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(?)
Justification: depends on size of array

[reverse on MDN][reverse]

## `[...arr]`

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(?)
Justification: depends on size of array
